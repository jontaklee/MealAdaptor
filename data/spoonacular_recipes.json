For days the wind has blown and blown, taking all the lovely yellow leaves with it. A few weeks ago, the heater was dusty in a corner of the room. Now, it's on nearly every evening.Time for gingerbread.We've been cooking out of the November issue of Gourmet all week, instead of a cookbook. Tonight, I intended to tell you all about that experience, and why I love the magazine so much. But I find myself, at the end of the evening, still bereft of words. We're leaving for a little trip in the morning, and I don't want to rush this. So tonight, I'll simply share this instead.One of the dessert recipes in the November issue was a pumpkin gingerbread trifle. I don't know about you, but trifles feel like summer to me. That and they have so many cups of custard (or in this case, pumpkin mousse) that eating the trifle would have kept me chained to the couch, in full nap form. So I passed it by when first deciding what to cook this week. Then, the rain started.Gingerbread, with its densely layered spices and dark molasses promise, seemed just the thing. Since I know that Gourmet recipes work, I felt comfortable converting it to a gluten-free version. I sifted and sniffed the spices, waited for the butter to soften on the counter, dug out the molasses, and started mixing. An hour later, we were holding gingerbread in our hands.I swear, Danny ate half the pan before bed last night. I mean, I helped too, but he really loved this stuff. \"This is good, honey.\" I just smiled. I love making him happy with baked goods.This morning, in dim light, I tried to take a photograph of the gingerbread. Puffed high, light, but still spongy-soft like crackers soaked in milk, this gingerbread is the best I've ever made. But on a saucer, on a countertop, it looked like a square of dark on white. The dark skies outside didn't help. Ready to give up, I brought it into our bedroom, on a table I like to shoot on sometimes. Before I could figure out the aperture, Little Bean grabbed a piece and started eating. I chased her around the room, laughing. Then stopped to look down and took this shot.Good enough for Little Bean?

Scrub each artichoke thoroughly with a stiff vegetable brush, and run it under some water. If grit seems to be trapped between the artichoke and its \"fingers\", you may have to pop them off to get the grit out.Make a brine out of ONE of the cups of salt, one gallon of water, and the 4 tablespoons of white vinegar.

I prefer to cut the artichokes into quarter inch dice by hand. Other folks use a food processor. The reason I don't use a food processor is because Jerusalem artichokes have a unique consistency, and they don't chop well in the food processor. Some of them get pulverized, while large chunks remain unchopped. So, if you like, use a food processor, but just make sure you don't end up with mush. You want a lot of very small chunks; it should look about the consistency of relish. As you cut the artichokes, place them in the brine.Make a second batch of brine with the remaining cup of salt and one gallon water, stirring well to make sure all the salt dissolves.In a food processor, chop the cabbage, onions, and bell peppers until they are cut fine. Make sure to keep an eye on what you are doing so you don't get mush. You want the vegetables to be the consistency of a relish.Once they are chopped, place the vegetables in the second batch of brine you made, and stir well.Cover both bowls of brined vegetables, and leave on the counter overnight or for 8 hours.
